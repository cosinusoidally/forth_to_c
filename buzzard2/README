Note the copyright is a bit weird on this. I think it was written by Sean
Barrett (https://github.com/nothings) for the International Obfuscated C Code
Contest in 1992, but the files in this directory are covered by the COPYRIGHT
file (and, unless otherwise indicated, only the files in this directory). I
assume the modifications to buzzard.c are also partially copywritten by the
author or ricardo forth, but I'm not sure.
